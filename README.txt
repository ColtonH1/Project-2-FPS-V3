To get points:
Collect treasure chest and shoot enemies

Goal:
Collect all 5 chests

*There are two health powerups and two armor powerups
*There is also a secret bonus point powerup in a hard to reach place 
*There is one slow down powerup near a mass group of enemies
	-strategically placed so if the player comes on the side it is not on, they
	will have more difficulty defeating them. 

*There are two weapons that you can change by scrolling on the mouse wheel

*The blue one does more damage, but with less range. The range is equal to most enemy ranges, 
so both player and enemy are firing at the same time

*The red one does less damage, but with more range and a faster rate of fire
The range is further than the enemy's range, so the player can begin to shoot before the
enemy gets close enough to shoot. Successful shot will result the enemy coming towards the player
even if not in range


About the game:

*Enemy will start to comes towards player if shot
*Player and enemy will continue to face each other when turning if in range
*Some enemies oscillate, going back and forth between point A and point B resembling the soldiers patrolling 
*Each powerup has working sound and disappears after being picked up
*Enemies vary in difficulty, like how fast they go for example
*Using both guns can vary the score and give you more or less points each round
*Getting hurt makes the player grunt
*Getting killed make the player yell
*Firing gun send a Star Wars like "pew" sound and the resulting impacting can be heard right 
after that

Note about the pause menu:
*I forgot to mention in the turn-in video that time does freeze when paused and also when dead
I know it's not mandatory, but I just wanted to point it out
*Also, I purposely didn't have the pause or death screen centered because I ran into the problem
of when dying, I was usually still firing at the enemy that killed me which since the gun 
fires in the middle of the screen, restart would be hit automatically. Only necessary for the
death screen, but I wanted the pause screen to match

What I am proud of:
The mini map is something I am really proud of because for a relatively simple implementation, 
I feel it adds a lot to the game play. I know it could look better, but graphic design is something
I need to learn still (I am a CS major, not ATCM)

I am also proud of the level design. I used free assets from the unity asset store and I feel as if
the level design resembles a somewhat realistic game (there are some points that could use improvement
and I would be willing to pay for assets if I needed to, but these turned out great for free.) I used what
I had to prevent the player from going off world/area and even added interesting scenery to add to the 
background story realness I had created.

Unique about the game:
*The gun is a ray gun, so I left a beam of light to emit as you shoot
*The gun has a light on it, so dark areas will be lit (mainly inside the shipping containers
*I added temporary armor worth 3 points each (less than damage an enemy will give) and the armor 
amount will appear on the top left HUD
*The health bar will change colors, it goes from green to red and the color varients in between as 
health decreases (or increases with health packs)
*Using different guns will allow the player to receive a unique score each round



Things I couldn't do, but wanted to:

*I tried to implement a power up to go faster, but that proved too difficult for how I have 
my scripts structured. After watching more YouTube tutorials, I noticed a better way to handle
the layout of the different scripts, but I did not have time to redo everything. I will know
for next time though.

*I tried to use a kill bot enemy (that I got from the unity asset store) that would have
been cool to use. There would have been double guns to fire. It even took me a while to 
get it working, however the NavMeshAgent wouldn't work with how I had the bots working.
I tried to find ways to fix the issue, but was unsuccessful and without the NavMeshAgent the 
AI couldn't move which is why I couldn't use them

*Simple animation seems like something I could learn (saw a video of Brackeys giving a gun
in FPS an animation to resemble the player breathing and moving). I will keep this topic
in mind for when I attempt to design my own games on my own time

*More complex animation, like player or AI movement seems more difficult. The soldiers I used 
came with animation and I attempted at first to implement the animation, but I did not know 
anything about the topic, so I wasn't able to implement it in this game, but as said about
simple animation, I will learn this later on since I actually do want to have a future in 
designing games.

*I also tried to implement a zoom function, but was short on time by them time I tried 
(since I need to start the next project now) and the difficulty proved to take too long.
I did see Brackeys animate in a simple way which is something I am sure I could learn to do.

I will try to implement these difficulties on this same project just for myself, so I can learn
how to do them.
